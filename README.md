# LibFT

A general purpose C library.

## WHY?

In Hive Helsinki we are not allowed to use the majority of the C standard library functions.
So in order to make future projects easier to develop, I have made a library containing highly useful functions including:

* String manipulations
* Linked list operations
* Memory managment
* IO operations
* And more

Using only the functions:

* malloc
* free
* read
* write
